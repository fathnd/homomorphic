// the storage would have been for a tensor that was lazily
// copied. However, when simulating this, we can't actually replace
// the storage because we would violate a core implementation
// invariant that tensors which are views of each other share the same
// storage.
//
// However, the fidelity of this check is limited by the extent to
// which we have instrumented operations as reading or writing to
// storage.
//
// We use a monotonically increasing generation number to track
// modifications to storage.
//
// Note that we templatize on whether or not we are eligible to be
// allocated into an intrusive_ptr. It *seems* as though ASan is
// unhappy if we stack-allocate an object that inherits from
// c10::intrusive_ptr_target.
